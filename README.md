# edoc-sample

This is example of reverse engineering of an existing document signature software that was slight modified to support some additional features. Also, there is extension that helps to avoid "Windows Security" window that requests for token PIN. The generated edoc can be easily open in "e-İmzalayıcı" software, but if you want to look at custom metadata, you have to open it in a sample program or implement custom template feature.
